        The Instacart mobile app allows customers to browse and order groceries right from their phone.
        Once a customer places an order, we assign a Personal Shopper, just like you, to pick the order.
        From there, thanks to Personal Shoppers like you, we can deliver that order door to door, in an hour or less.

        As a Personal Shopper, you'll be given access to a special version of the Instacart mobile app, which allows
        you to be notifed as soon as a new order comes in. The app will walk you through every step of the process, and
        provide assistance should you need it. All you need is your handy-dandy smartphone of choice, and you've ready to shop.

        Don't have a car? No problem! Personal Shoppers are broken into two teams. The In-Store Shoppers, who work out
        of a particular grocery store, and handle picking and assembling orders as they come in. Once an order is complete,
        a second Personal Shopper with a car pick it up to do final delivery to the customer.

        pick up. At the end of each week, we calculate how many hours you've worked, and pay you quickly and directly. It's too easy!
